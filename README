Bober is a web-based bebras competition system written in php using the yii framework.
It is easily localizable and is written to be scalable.

As of 2015, most development is going on under django/.

The django version uses standard gettext .po files for the messages. The message files can
be found under django/bober/*/locale/*.

If you want to localize the old version of the system, look under backend/messages
for examples.
